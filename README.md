# vax-trax

Vax-trax is a blog web site where users can track their progress for the vaccination process of the Covid-19 virus.  

Users can recieve up to date information about the state of the covid-19 virus in regards to infection, deaths and how many others have had their first and second shots.  This information can be catagorized by state.  

The user can track, what shot they are recieving, when the dates are that they will be going to get them and they can also blog about their experience.  

The user can then access other peoples experience that use the site.  The site uses cdc databases and also stores user information on its own database.  This site is deployed through heroku.

## Future Goals

While the web-application is geared toward the novel carona virus we may see that this may be a helpful tool and landing page for people in the future getting other vaccines.  Adding a variety of vaccinations to the page may be helpfull not only for indivdual purposes but also public health services.  

We would also like to see the list of capabilities grow.  This would be in terms of what we are tracking and the information that could be divulged from their.  This would include mapping, more finite localization for usership (moving from a state model to a more localized model) and creating a more apt communication effort that would send information to the user more readily and promptly.
